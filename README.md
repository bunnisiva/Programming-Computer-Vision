# Programming-Computer-Vision

How does a machine see an image, we start from there ! It becomes an adventure and a beautiful story to tell!
I am creating mini-projects to go over various Image processing techniques that are necessary for any vision projects. 
There are two paths now.
Programming Computer Vision using Python.
Programming Computer Vision using OpenCV ( still python based).
Programming Vision in C ++ .
I am starting with some very basic skills necessary to understand Image data . I start off with just reading in Images , processing it like resize, rotate etc.
I then move to various filtering techniques all in very simple code and I added extra explanations so that anyone who is interested to do Vision but are intimidated by its math ( yes it is mathy, I love math) but still can be a lot of fun.
I will keep adding more scripts and more techniques as I learn and understand and try them on various testcases.
I will also be doing real time tutorials, object indentification techniques , all using python and CV. 
I also will add my own raw images to try different morphing texniques on them, applying various edge/corner detectors and actually see what they represent mathematically without memorizing those equations ( Calculus3 will help a lot if anyone wants to dive deep) .
I used some pictures from the free website called unsplash. Please support the photographers, they are very gifted . I do have their name on the names of the jpgs, so if anyone wants to check out their  and other photographers pics , u can do that ,
I will also add links to various courses I took to get my understanding of Image data more from mathematical side of it, if anyone is interested in that 
Most of all I want to share my passion of Computer Vision through these tutorials.
I an avid reader and I like to experiemnet with various code and try various ways to understand all the concepts. This sometimes makes me to read/work on a topic for few hours to few days. I learnt to be patient with myself and now I see all coming together and here I am adding my findings and my hobby/passion into code 
Great books that are sources are OpenCV3 Computer Vision Cookbook by Packt, Programming Computer Vision by JanErik sOlem( beautifully explained concepts) by Reilly publications
Excellent lectures by Dr Mubarack from UCF.He explained all the filtering, segmentaion techniques very clearly. 
I will be adding image transformations on my own images from my high resolution camera. I will be showing how to add labels and use them in different pre trained/ CNN models( That is a whole new project series, but I will be doing it ) 
All big things start with small beginnings .Here to it. 
Thank you !!!!! for visiting my hub!!!!
